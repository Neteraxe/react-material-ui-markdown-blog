The programmer is undoubtly true as something. I always find it the skill of programmer is more appealing as a symbol. When I didn't do work like programmer, I take it as a magic art. Now I have a plenty mass about programming, I found it cheap.

It's a mass developers, but tell who is better, even the senior programmer couldn't answer. I rather to do more about some subjects more basic, which have true meanings.
